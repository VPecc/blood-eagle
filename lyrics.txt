verse:
Crawling faintly on an open field
Last chance on this scorched earth
Innocent and naive
Hopes to see another day

Weak and tired
It lost the will
of ever seeing a better day

WAIT!
HELP!

chorus:
The blood eagle
Flies on the golden skies
Searching for prey
Cruel claws dig so deep

The blood eagle
Hunts over vast lands
Never stop, never show mercy
The king of the End of times

[awesome guitar riff]
